## Terminology

I'm given 6 *images*, each containing a *grid* of *figures* and the
*program* must choose between 4 to 8 *figure alternatives*. A figure
usually contains 1-3 *subfigures*, like a circle or a rectangle. A
*complete grid* is a grid with a figure alternative inserted in the
bottom right placeholder.

If not specified, the *similarity* between two images is just the definition
given in Kunda's presentation, namely the number of pixels in the  intersection
divided by the number of pixels in the union.

## Running the program

      $ python ArashRouhani_Project_4.py

Works for me. It takes a few minutes on my machine. My program uses
*opencv* for most of its image processing but also *pymorph* for the
parts involving morphological operations. Meanwhile opencv has to be
installed on the graders machine (I know a lot of my class mates used it
too), pymorph is attached in the zip file and should just work.

### Experimenting with the programs verbosity

Just like for my previous projects you can experiment with my programs verbosity
by uncommenting a few lines in the file `ArashRouhani_Project_4.py`. My program
does some meta reasoning by choosing which reasoner is most likely to be
correct (either the visual or the representational one). The comments in that source
file will explain exactly how the verbosity switches work.

## The visual representations

My program doesn't have any requirements for the dimensionality on the
image files as it will resize them once they are read. Furthermore since
the image quality were terrible in the provided image I had to redraw
some images.

## Visual Solution Overview

**This time I did the visual solution**. Which means I work directly on the
bitmap of the images and I do not use anything from project 2 anymore.

My solution is simple. I define a *judge* as a function taking a
*complete grid* and returning a score. For example, on a 2 by 2 grid,
the judge for mirroring will be the function that looks how much the
mirroring of the top left image in the grid is similar to the top right
image in the grid. It then also checks the corresponding similarity in
the bottom row. If the images on the left with mirroring appears to be
alike their right side counterparts, then a high score is awarded.

Then I implement a set of judges and run each judge on a grid with the unknown
figure replaced with each alternative and pick the alternative that has a
judge which gets most satisfied (gives highest score).

### Implemented judges

In order to be able to see different patterns, I've added judges for all
patterns present in the data set. Most of the judges are similarity
based and some other judges don't fall in any category. To make it even
clearer that each judge has its purpose in solving the given example
problems, I've added the [x-y] notation next to the judges meaning that
it's that partiuclar judge that solves problem [x-y].

#### Similarity based judges

In the case of 2x2 grids these judges work just like the mirroring judge
example above, only that there are transformations other than mirroring.
In the 3x3 case these judges will think of it as a 2x2 grid by removing
the second row and first column of the grid. The concrete transformations
I have are rotation [2-1, 2-3, 2-7], copy mirroring (let right side of
image be a mirrored copy of left side) [2-2] and also the identity
transformation [2-4]. To honor how my reasoning for project 2 and 3
works, I decided to once again not consider mirroring as a
transformation.

#### xor row-elements and compare [2-5]

This is a 3x3 only solver. It captures the fact that a row has one part
in common and one that alternates. This judge will favor when the rows
individually has a common part but also has an alternating part that is
equal.  For the [2.5] example the common part for the first row is the
circle and for the last row it's the cross. They both exist, also the
alternating parts, the configuration of the rod in the middle is the
same for both rows.

To actually implement this I combined a xor with other basic bitmap
manipulations.


#### Pixel count variation [2-6, 2-8, 3-7, 3-8]

To solve the problems involving increasing triangles, I use the fact that the
number of triangles is proportional to the number of pixels. Again using xor and
other basic manipulations we capture yet another concept of images: Increasing
number of figures in a grid pattern.

To see the details of how this works I refer to the source code which is just a
very few and short lines. See `src/visual/transformations.py`

## Intelligence is hard -- A discussion

Naturally, since my program only has a few judges and their main
specification was to "pass the test data", this program won't be so
intelligent and able to solve new problems. However, since I think that
there are so many patterns that it's impossible to even begin to think
how to implement something more general. In all visual approaches that I
can think of, one must add new logic for each new kind of pattern you
want your program to detect. I also think that my algorithm is just a
mini-version of the Affine Method described in *Taking a Look
(Literally!) at the Ravenâ€™s Intelligence Test: Two Visual Solution
Strategies*. Even with the extra features presented in their paper their
Affine Method approach can't adapt and understand new patterns.
Nevertheless both approaches have one intelligent component, they can
both report back which strategy they used to determine their answer.
The answer is *verifiable*. While a human might not find the pattern,
she can be convinced that the computer has found the right pattern if
the program says "90 degree rotation" because the human can then easily
verify that.  Since the computer program can say why it choose the
answer it did it will rightfully appear much more intelligent just for
that's sake.

## Meta reasoning

I strongly believe that my propositional solver from project 2 is very
powerful. What weakens it is that its search depth have been extremely
limited since it's so slow, also the representation extractor from
project 3 isn't perfect, for example it didn't work for problem [3-8].
My visual reasoner feels more like a hack, however, it actually does the
job for [3-8]. Based on that I decided to use this meta reasoning
policy: **Begin.** If the representational solver finds a reasonable
solution, use that, otherwise entrust in the visual solver. **End.**
Here "reasonable" means below a certain threshold in penalty score.

## Ablation experiments

One ablation one can do with the visual reasoner is the possibility to
remove some of the judges. However the outcome will be as we expect, we
won't be able to solve the problems what the judge were designed to
solve anymore.

Another experiment is to remove the meta reasoner and always use the
representational or the visual reasoner. First of all I notice that the
visual reasoner is much faster than the representational (and that is
because of the non visual part from project 2). Second one notices that
only the visual reasoner solves [3-8].
